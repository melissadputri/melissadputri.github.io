### [Intro to Java: Shadow Mario Game!](https://github.com/melissadputri/shadow-mario-game)
- Language: Java
- For my first introductory course to Java, I created a Shadow Mario game according to the given assignment specifications. This project gave me insight to concepts in Java programming such as abstract classes, interfaces, as well as creating a UML diagram.

### [Forecasting IMDB Scores](https://github.com/melissadputri/imdb-forecasting)
- Language: Python
- Applying machine learning models to forecast IMDB scores based given features of a movie. Comparing the performance of several machine learning models and analysing the tradeoffs.

### [Analyzing Fertility Rates in Fiji: A Statistical Model on the Impact of Marriage Duration, Residence, and Education](https://melissadputri.github.io/Analyzing_Fertility_Rates.zip)
- Language: R
- Utilizes data from the Fiji Fertility Survey to investigate factors influencing fertility rates among married women of Indian descent in Fiji.
- The dataset classifies the number of children ever born (nChildren) based on three key factors: the duration of marriage (grouped in six categories), place of residence (Suva, urban, or rural), and educational level (none, lower primary, upper primary, or secondary or higher). - The aim is to determine how these factors, along with their potential interactions, are related to fertility rates.
